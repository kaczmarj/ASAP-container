# ASAP container

[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/kaczmarj/asap?label=DockerHub&style=flat)](https://hub.docker.com/r/kaczmarj/asap)

```
docker pull kaczmarj/asap:2.0.0
```

or

```
singularity pull docker://kaczmarj/asap:2.0.0
```

Workflow is to build the Docker image and then convert to a Singularity image.
Singularity tends to play better with graphical interfaces.

ASAP is available at https://github.com/computationalpathologygroup/ASAP.
